Problem Statement: Given a number X,  print its factorial. To obtain the factorial of a number, it has to be multiplied by all the whole numbers preceding it. More precisely X! = X*(X-1)*(X-2) â€¦ 1.
Note: X  is always a positive number. 

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
  int n;
  cin>>n;
  int fact=1;
  
  for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
    fact=fact*i;
  }
  cout<<fact;
}

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
